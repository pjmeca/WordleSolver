Welcome to `WordleSolver`! A software to reversely solve the famous Wordle game (that's right, this software tells you the words instead of asking you).

## How to play

To play a game, install and launch the app and click on each letter to tell `WordleSolver` if the correct word contains it, but not in that position (orange), contains it in that exact position (green), or doesn't contain it at all (gray, default option).
You can use it to play against the [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) or, if you prefer to, play against yourself (will you be able to beat it, or will the algorithm beat you forever??? \*\****triggering intensifies***\*\*).
